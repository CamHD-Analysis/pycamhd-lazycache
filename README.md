# PyLazyCamHD

Python API for accessing [CamHD](http://novae.ocean.washington.edu/story/Ashes_CAMHD_Live) data from a  [go-lazycache](https://github.com/amarburg/go-lazycache) instance.   
As we're calling the the HTTP API exposed by Lazycache, this package is extremely
lightweight  --- basically just a wrapper around HTTP requests.

## Test

   python -m pytest
